# When Causality meets Computer Vision

The repository contains lists of papers on causality and how relevant techniques are being used to further enhance deep learning era computer vision solutions. 

The repository is organized by Maheep Chaudhary and [Haohan Wang](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~haohanw/) as an effort to collect and read relevant papers and to hopefully serve the public as a collection of relevant resources.

  - [Adversarial Visual Robustness by Causal Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09534) 
      - <details><summary>Maheep's notes </summary>
         The paper focuses on adverserial training so as to prevent from adverserial attacks. The author use instrumental variable to achieve casual intervention.            The author proposes 2 techniques, i.e. 
         
         1) Augments the image with multiple retinoptic centres
         
         2) Encourage the model to learn causal features, rather than local confounding patterns.
         
         They propose the model to be such that max P (Y = ŷ|X = x + delta) - P(Y = ŷ|do(X = x + delta)), 
         subject to P (Y = ŷ|do(X = x + delta)) = P (Y = ŷ|do(X = x)), in other words they focus on annhilating the confounders using the retinotopic centres as the instrumental variable.
